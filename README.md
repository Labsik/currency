## Notes

1. I've created a proxy server for fetching data. The Privatbank API doesn't work as expected due to CORS issues;
2. For convering a currency the first time you need to click an 'Convert' button. The inputs swapped as at Google Translator

How to start a project:

1. npm install
2. cd frontend && npm install or cd frontend && yarn
3. cd ..
4. npm run dev
